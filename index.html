      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <div class="elevatorPitch">
        I have been attending Oakland University for 3 years. Before attending
        Oakland University I worked as a Data Analyst after high school, and
        moved into web development during the pandemic. I currently work for an
        investment firm working as a web developer where I specailizse in JWT,
        and token atuhentication systems inside of the open banking reguatlions.
        I am attending university as having a college degreee will help me
        expand into new markets without the worry of having work experience
        without a college degree.
        <br />
        <br />
        Outside of work and university I play guitar and mountain bike. I have
        two dogs and recently bought a house in Auburn Hills that I am working
        on fixing.
