        <br />
        Outside of school I work on open banking regulations and develop
        documentations and guidelines for investment firms moving into open
        bakning and special needs assessment.
        <h5>Open Banking Token Authentication</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Building upon Franklin Templeton's Fiduciary Trusts website, I
            developed a new sign in page that followed Open Banking regulations,
            requiring a JWT refresh token to create a 90 day Bearer Token that
            can be used as proof of identification when signing in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Azure Active Directory B2C as the authentication server, that
            directory is used to store and create tokens that are then shared
            with Franklin Templeton, which can be shared with other financial
            institutions without putting the customers personal information at
            risk of being known..
          </li>
          <li>
            This project is used as a baseline of where Fiduciary Trusts will be
            heading in the future with open banking, and is the example of what
            authentication systems must follow within Franklin Templeton as they
            expand into blockchain and open banking.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Special Needs Analysis Webpage</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designing a multi-page application with sign-up and login
            credentials to save users information, the application was headed by
            the three Frontend interns including myself on Angular.
          </li>
          <li>
            Creating a RouterComponent to store router-link information, and
            coordinating API requests before page loading to ensure data is
            received before rendering outputs, the navigation between multiple
            pages allowed the data to consistently be stored in the services and
            interfaces we had established.
